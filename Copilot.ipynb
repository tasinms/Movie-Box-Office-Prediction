    "The Bayesian estimate is a statistical technique that combines a prior estimate and the observed data to produce a more accurate estimate. It's based on Bayes' theorem, a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of calculating the success score for an actor, the Bayesian estimate is used to reduce the bias that can occur when an actor has been in a small number of movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior estimate**: This is our initial guess before we see any data. In this case, it's the mean success rate for all actors. We also assume a certain number of \"prior observations\" - in the provided code, this is set to 10. This number represents our confidence in the prior estimate. The higher this number, the more evidence we need to move away from the prior estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observed data**: This is the actual data we have, i.e., the success and failure scores for each actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bayesian estimate**: This is a weighted average of the prior estimate and the observed data. The weights depend on the number of observations. If an actor has been in many movies, the observed data will have a higher weight. If an actor has been in few movies, the prior estimate will have a higher weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the Bayesian estimate in this case is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(actorMoviesCount[actor] * actorSuccessFailureScore[actor] + 10 * mean_success_rate) / (actorMoviesCount[actor] + 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula calculates a weighted average of the actor's success score and the mean success rate. The weights are the number of movies the actor has been in and the number of prior observations (10), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a Bayesian estimate, we're essentially saying, \"Unless an actor has been in a lot of movies, we're going to assume they're about average.\" This helps to prevent actors with few movies (but high success rates) from being ranked too highly."
